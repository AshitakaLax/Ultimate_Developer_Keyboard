Ultimate_Developer_Keyboard
===========================

Ultimate left single hand keyboard for Devloping, Macros, and gaming. Code for MCU, Code for Windows service program, keyboard Hardware schematics, Keyboard Plastic templates.


This Project is broken down into 3 sections

1. Keyboard Software - this is the embedded code on a custom dev board(Atmel Sam4E), with hopes to move to a smaller chip to save cost.
2. Windows Software - this will be the smart portion of the system. It will determine the current IDE, and switch to it's custom keyboard layout.
3. Keyboard Hardware - This is all of the documentation for the hardware of this system, schematics, STL's, etc...


This system will be developed with Industrial quality tools, mainly because I like my time.

Keyboard Software Tools - Atmel Studio 6.2
Windows Software Tools - Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate
Keyboard Hardware Tools - (PCB)Altium Designer ,(Plastics) TBD
